# This table defines the mapping used by the binary merge-vads to 
# combine the output of compute-vad and compute-vad-from-frame-likes.
# The first column corresponds to VAD decisions from compute-vad
# and the second corresponds to VAD decisions from
# compute-vad-from-frame-likes.  The labels "0" and "1" in the
# first column represent (approximately) silence and nonsilence
# respectively.  The labels "0", "1", "2", "3" in the second column
# represent noise, speech, music, mix(speech+music), respectively.  The third
# column lists the resulting output labels: "0", "1", "2", "3", "4"
# corresponding to silence, noise, speech, music, mix.
